# Flippy: A ToonTown Rewritten invasion tracker

Tracker for ToonTown Rewritten, sending pings whenever certain invasions are happening in game.

### TL:DR

Within the game ToonTown Rewritten, there are in-game events called "invasions", in which a district (game server) will only spawn the invading cog. Some ToonTasks (quests) in game require the player to defeat certain types of cogs, and invasions are useful for hunting those cogs. This application aims to track when certain cogs have invasions going on, so the user can be notified and complete their tasks.
